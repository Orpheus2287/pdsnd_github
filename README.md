### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data Project

### Description
In this project I used Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data spanning three major cities - Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

I was tasked with creating a python program that calculates statistics, and building an interactive environment where a user can choose their data and filter a dataset to analyze.
