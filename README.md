# **Project Title**
Exploration of US Bikeshare Data

# **Project Description**
In this project I used Python to:
1. Explore U.S. bikeshare data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
2. Create code that imports the data and allows the user to answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
3. Providee the user with an interactive environment where they can choose their data and filter a dataset to analyze.
