### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data Project

### Description
In this project I used Python to explore U.S. bikeshare data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

I used Python to create code that imports the data and allows the user to answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The program provides the user with an interactive environment where they are able to choose their data and filter a dataset to analyze.
